# Utility Scripts

My repository for various utility scripts I write or modify. I try to only
include things that would be useful outside of my own computer, but this
repository is mainly for me and sometimes a couple environment-specific things
will slip in.  

## Contents  

### Python
* md_linklist.py -- Asks user for a file name number of links and generates an empty list of markdown hyperlinks for the user to populate manually.  

### Awk
* passwd.sh -- A more readable format of the etc/passwd file. (This script used to be in its own repository, since archived)
